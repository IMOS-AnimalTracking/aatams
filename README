The sub-folders and their contents is as follows:

1. data file processing
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Receipt and processing of receiver files into database.

The java classes responsible for this processing are actually utilised from within the ZK framework
but are not linked to ZK. ZK just provides the upload and save to disk steps, the processing
from that point is done by the code in this folder.

There are three requirements from that point. 
1. Process the file data into a database
2. Update metadata
3. Create a report and send to registered parties of interest.

See the README and javadoc for more details on these steps.

2. data access
++++++++++++++

Search for and download data.

This is a web-page that gets embedded in the ZK app. It basically allows the user to search for AATAMS
data and download it. 

It is going to the WFS for some data and for detections data to ???

3. forms
++++++++

Xforms for data maintenance in relational database, these are auto generated from the 
schema document (aatams.xml) in the scripts folder.

These form use the XSLTForms XForms framework, which is an all browser based XForms implementation.
It translates an XForm document into HTML using an stylesheet processing instruction added at the start
of the Xform. 

The main reason for using these is to be able to make use of a WFS as the data service and then also
the deegree owsProxy to implement user rights restrictions on the AATAMS data.

4. zk
+++++

zk Web application framework, provides main AATAMS web page, menu items are effectively pages 'embedded' within the ZK app as an iframe that
forms the "centre" panel as specified in the index.zul page definition file, as below:

<center flex="true" margins="5,0,5,0">
	<iframe id="iframe" src="http://imos.org.au/aatams.html" width="500px" height="500px" scrolling="auto"
				style="border: 1px solid gray" />
</center>

5. wfs
++++++

Web Feature Services (WFS), provides main data access services.

All the XForms access the WFS to get data to display and also to build transactions for adding data into the database via the WFS.

6. scripts
++++++++++

Scripts for generation of forms, schemas etc.
